        description:    "Students enhance their JavaScript skills to become \
productive with Full-stack development. They use a hands-on approach to build \
APIs using Node.JS and a variety of tools, frameworks, libraries and packages. \
The creation of these modern APIs also requires the students to develop skills \
with persistent scalable database storage systems. Project work culminates with \
students creating APIs to be used with websites and mobile applications. \
Students work individually as well as with other students to complete tasks.",
